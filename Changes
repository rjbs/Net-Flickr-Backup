        - big changes, but hopefully all backward compatible...
        - logs changed to be easier to skim
        - fixed bugs in filename generation, will will result in some files
          being renamed
        - use LWP::UserAgent's "mirror" to avoid unneeded downloads
        - file extensions for videos are set, either .mp4 or .video-X
        - file extensions for photos are correct; PNGs are no longer named .jpg
        - no longer attempts to download video original for still photos
        - always generate HTTPS links to Flickr
        - lots of reformatting of the code

!!! Logs for previous changes are found in Changes.rdf, which may some day be
    rewritten into ... well, something other than RDF.
